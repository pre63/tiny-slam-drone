# Testing Framework Overview

This directory will contain:
- Unit tests for individual modules (flight control, sensor fusion, SLAM, navigation, calibration, diagnostics).
- Integration tests for the complete control loop.
- Simulation-based tests comparing AirSim sensor outputs with expected values.
- Performance benchmarks for real-time control and TinyML inference.
